# VPReader
VideoPsalm© reader for mac

VPReader is a free reader for VideoPsalm© agenda (file .vpagd).

VPReader opens files generated by the Windows version of VideoPsalm©.

So, VPReader is not standalone application. Use  ".vpagd" examples files provided in dmg archive to test it.

If you are an user, see it as an extra solution in case you need to display VideoPsalm© agendas from a Mac.

If you are a developper, see it as a first step in the mac world for VideoPsalm©. Let me invit you to have a look at the functions in charge of reading of vpagd files, some information about [fileformat](vpagd_file_format.json) and thinks at others solutions than standalone application (i.e. web/mobile applications) to enhance VideoPsalm©, this great software !

VPReader rely on PySide, a free implementation of QT for Python: Be indulgent, I'm a beginner!

For now, I am releasing an Apple Silicon (aka m1/m2) version of VPReader.
